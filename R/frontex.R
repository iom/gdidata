#'   The data refer to detections of illegal border-crossing rather than the
#'   number of persons, as the same person may cross the external border several
#'   times. However, there is currently no EU system in place capable of tracing
#'   each personâ€™s movements following an illegal border-crossing. Therefore, it
#'   is not possible to establish the precise number of persons who have
#'   illegally crossed the external border.

#'   Mentions of Kosovo are in the context of UN Security Council Resolution
