Period covered is currently Oct 2017 to Mar 2025. The latest CSV
file is downloaded from
https://www.cbp.gov/document/stats/nationwide-encounters. Data is
originally reported by fiscal year, which begins in October. The time
columns \code{t} and \code{q} are the calendar year equivalents.

\code{authority} is either Title 8 or Title 42 of the U.S. Code. Encounters of
noncitizens are generally processed under Title 8, encompassing laws on
"Aliens and Nationality". A public health order during the COVID-19
pandemic allowed for the immediate expulsion of noncitizens under Title 42.
Except for a temporary suspension from 15 November to 19 December 2022,
this policy was in force from 21 March 2020 to 11 May 2023.

Possible values for \code{demog} are "Single Adults", "FMUA" (individuals in a
family unit), "Accompanied Minors" and "UC / Single Minors". FMUA
represents the number of encountered individuals within the family unit,
defined as at least one noncitizen minor child and at least one noncitizen
legal guardian. Accompanied minors represent inadmissible children
accompanied by a legal guardian who is either a U.S. citizen, lawful
permanent resident, or admissible noncitizen. Accompanied minors is a
demographic used only by OFO.
